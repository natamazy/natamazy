  <h1>✅ Yes – Everyone Should Learn How to Code</h1>

  <h2>1. Essential Digital Literacy</h2>
  <div class="comment">
Coding is becoming part of modern literacy. Being tech-aware means being able to read and write the language of the digital world.

“Computational Thinking, 10 Years Later” – Jeannette Wing (Mar 23, 2016). Wing argues that coding and computational thinking are becoming fundamental literacies. She predicts that by the mid-21st century, computational thinking will be a basic skill for everyone, “as fundamental as reading, writing and arithmetic.” This highlights coding as an essential part of modern education and digital literacy​

  <h2>2. Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving</h2>
  <div class="comment">
Coding isn't just about syntax — it's about thinking logically and solving real problems step-by-step.

“How does coding enhance problem-solving skills in education?” – India Today (Aug 28, 2024). This feature explains that learning to code inherently develops logical reasoning and problem-solving abilities. Students learn to break down complex problems into smaller parts and solve them systematically (a process known as computational thinking). According to the article, coding “enhances students’ problem-solving, logical thinking, and creativity across subjects,” improving performance in other academic areas and fostering critical thinking skills​
INDIATODAY.IN
. In today’s digital age, it argues, “coding has become as essential as reading and writing,” underlining its role in building analytical skills for future success​

“Exploring the Relationship Between Coding, Computational Thinking and Problem Solving in Early Elementary Students” – Morgan Relkin & Marina U. Bers (2020). This academic study (presented at AERA 2020) provides empirical support that learning to code can improve general problem-solving skills. After a 6-week coding curriculum with 7–9 year-olds, researchers found students’ unplugged problem-solving abilities significantly improved in correlation with their coding proficiency. The results indicate that learning to code boosted children’s problem-solving skills, especially when they applied coding knowledge through computational thinking​

  <h2>3. Economic Empowerment and Job Market Advantage</h2>
  <div class="comment">
In many industries, knowing how to code opens doors — or at least gives you a foot in.

“Half of the highest-paying jobs in America now require this skill” – MarketWatch (Aug 13, 2017). This news analysis reports that coding skills confer a clear advantage in the job market. A study of 26 million job postings found that roughly half of jobs in the top income quartile (>$57k salaries) require at least some programming ability​
MARKETWATCH.COM
. In simpler terms, many high-paying careers in fields from finance to medicine now expect coding or computer science knowledge. This data-backed insight illustrates that learning to code can open doors to more job opportunities and higher earnings, making it a valuable economic skill.
“Will learning to code help you get a job?” – Charlotte Seager, The Guardian (Apr 14, 2015). This article highlights that as industries become increasingly digital, programming skills are in high demand across diverse careers – not just in tech. It notes that software development was the fastest-growing industry in the UK, with an “international shortage of coders”​
THEGUARDIAN.COM
. Even fields like medicine, design, and journalism benefit from employees who can code or understand technology. One startup founder quoted says, “As the world becomes increasingly digital, coding is going to become a necessary skill for more and more jobs.” Demand for coding proficiency is growing in the digital economy, so those who can code gain a competitive edge in the job market​

  <h2>4. Fostering Innovation and Creativity</h2>
  <div class="comment">
Coding is a creative act — you make apps, games, art, tools. You invent and build.

“Mitch Resnick: The Next Generation of Scratch Teaches More Than Coding” – Mitchel Resnick (Jan 3, 2019). MIT Media Lab professor Mitchel Resnick explains that the true goal of teaching kids to code is to cultivate creativity and innovation. He notes that his team’s mission with Scratch is to engage students in “thinking creatively, reasoning systematically and working collaboratively”, which are essential skills for everyone​
EDSURGE.COM
. Coding is presented as a creative outlet: through projects like games or animations, students learn to express themselves creatively with technology​
EDSURGE.COM
. This source supports the idea that coding education isn’t just technical training – it nurtures imagination, experimentation, and innovative thinking in learners.
“The Benefits of Teaching Kids to Code” – Simone Migliori, Boston College Magazine (Fall 2023). This profile of Professor Marina Umaschi Bers highlights how coding can unlock children’s creative potential. Bers argues that teaching coding is “about much more than vocational skills.” “Coding,” she said, “is an effective way for children to learn creativity, collaboration, generosity, and open-mindedness.” She views coding as a new form of personal expression, akin to a digital playground where kids can invent and collaborate​
BC.EDU
. For example, her ScratchJr programming tool lets children create interactive stories and games, blending coding with art and storytelling. This shows that learning to code can foster innovation and creativity, encouraging young people to become creators rather than just consumers of technology.</div>

  <h2>5. Democratizing Access to Technology</h2>
  <div class="comment">
When more people know how to code, fewer are left behind in the digital revolution.

“Growing Digital Literacy through Coding” – UNESCO (Dec 2020, updated Apr 2023). UNESCO describes coding as a driver of social inclusion, noting that coding skills allow people not just to use technology but to create it. The article details how initiatives like Africa Code Week empower youth across Africa by providing free coding workshops and teacher training. This democratizes technology access, enabling students and educators even in underserved regions to participate in the digital revolution. It observes that connecting schools via coding education “crosses so many boundaries where schools from even the remotest of areas can address their digital problems and learn together.” By equipping marginalized communities with coding clubs and resources, such programs help level the playing field so that not only privileged groups, but everyone, can innovate with technology​
UNESCO.ORG
.
“The Democratization of Education – A Global Frontier” – Toptal Research (2018). This analysis highlights the worldwide push to make tech skills like coding accessible to all, not just a select few. It notes that technology is a “democratizing force,” and improving global access to tech education is a priority for organizations like Mozilla, IBM, and the United Nations​
TOPTAL.COM
. Efforts such as scholarships for women in STEM and widespread online coding courses are cited as ways to break down barriers. The source supports the argument that teaching everyone to code can democratize the tech world – shifting power and knowledge from a limited elite to a broader population. In essence, universal coding literacy means more diverse creators solving problems and contributing to innovation, ultimately making the benefits of technology more equitable.</div>

  <h2>6. Early Exposure Builds Future Competence</h2>
  <div class="comment">
Like learning a language, starting early makes coding more intuitive and less intimidating later.

“Coding Class, Then Naptime: Computer Science for the Kindergarten Set” – NPR (Education) (Sept 18, 2015). This report illustrates the advantages of introducing coding at an early age. It cites educators who argue that if we taught coding basics in elementary school – just like we teach reading or math – we would give students years to build mastery. One expert notes that “this early introduction is key to broadening participation in STEM disciplines.” By starting in kindergarten, children (including girls and underrepresented minorities) become comfortable with computing, which can inspire them to pursue tech fields later​
NPR.ORG
. The piece also points out that young kids can learn coding concepts through play (e.g. using simple coding toys and games), which makes the learning fun and accessible. Early exposure thus lays a strong foundation and prepares children for a future where computing competence is essential.
“The Benefits of Teaching Kids to Code” – Simone Migliori (Fall 2023). Focusing on Professor Marina Bers’s work, this article reinforces that even the youngest students gain lasting benefits from early coding education. Today, coding is being integrated into curricula for very young learners. The idea is that children who start coding in early grades develop fluency with technology just as they do with languages. Bers’s research (in Boston and internationally) shows that kindergarteners can learn programming concepts (for example, with tangible coding blocks) and that these experiences build confidence and skills they carry forward​
BC.EDU
​
BC.EDU
. Early coding also ties into social-emotional learning – one project cited uses coding activities to help Israeli and Palestinian kindergarteners collaborate and express themselves, suggesting that starting young not only builds future tech competence but also teamwork and communication. Overall, multiple sources agree that introducing coding in elementary school better prepares students for advanced computing later on, making the next generation more capable in our technology-driven world.

  <h1>❌ No – Not Everyone Needs to Learn How to Code</h1>

  <h2>1. Not All Careers Require Coding</h2>
  <div class="comment">Many jobs simply don’t need programming. Forcing it on everyone may be a waste of time and energy.

“Should Everybody Learn to Code?” – Esther Shein, Communications of the ACM (Feb 2014). This article examines the “code for all” trend and concludes that blanket coding proficiency isn’t necessary for everyone. Not every profession needs programming skills, and Shein quotes experts who suggest focusing on broader computational thinking. As Shein put it, “not everyone needs coding skills, but learning how to think like a programmer can be useful in many disciplines.”​
RESEARCHGATE.NET
 This implies that a basic understanding of logical problem-solving may benefit all students, but writing code itself is superfluous for many careers outside the tech sphere. In fields like law, medicine, or art, one can be successful with general digital literacy or domain-specific software, without ever writing a line of code.
Opinion: “Mandatory Coding Classes May Not Be Necessary” – Patrick Gray, TechRepublic/Education World (2016). A tech consultant, Gray argues that the push to teach all students coding isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. He notes that advocates want to put coding alongside reading and math, but in reality “some of the fundamental concerns of the ‘learn to code’ movement are legitimate” while coding itself “may not be the only answer.” The skills gained from coding (like troubleshooting and logic) can also be acquired through other activities. Gray points out that we don’t require every student to learn automotive repair or advanced calculus—similarly, not every student will need programming in their career. His view is that we should offer coding opportunities to those interested, but mandating it for all could misallocate educational time for students whose talents and career paths lie elsewhere (for example, in trades, the arts, or service industries where other skills are far more relevant).</div>

  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Patrick Gray, TechRepublic (2016)<br>
  Suggests that while coding is useful, it shouldn’t be required for students uninterested in tech.</p>

  <h2>2. One-Size-Fits-All Education Is Ineffective</h2>
  <div class="comment">Forcing coding on everyone doesn’t work — schools and students have different needs and resources.
  Opinion: “Mandatory Coding Classes May Not Be Necessary” – Patrick Gray (2016). Gray cautions that enforcing coding on every student is a “proscriptive approach” that assumes one path fits all learners. He states, “Subjecting generations of students and workers to mandatory coding education is the wrong way to accomplish an otherwise noble goal.” Instead of imposing a single approach, he suggests teaching critical thinking, problem-solving, and technical fluency through various subjects that suit different students​
EDUCATIONWORLD.COM
​
EDUCATIONWORLD.COM
. For example, a student might learn analytical skills through science experiments or music, rather than JavaScript. Gray’s point is that a rigid “code or bust” curriculum could alienate students who might excel in other domains. A more flexible strategy would embed logical thinking across the curriculum (in shop class, art, literature, etc.) rather than requiring a coding class for everyone. This tailored approach avoids the pitfall of one-size-fits-all and respects that students have diverse strengths and interests.
“Moving the Needle on Equity in Computer Science Education” – Urban Institute (2023). This study of New York City’s CS4All rollout implicitly shows why a uniform coding-for-all mandate can fall short. By 2022, only 20% of NYC schools were able to reach all students with a computer science course, and a full 46% of schools offered CS to fewer than 10% of their students (with 8% offering none at all)​
URBAN.ORG
​
URBAN.ORG
. Despite the universal policy, implementation varied widely – especially in under-resourced schools – and participation dropped in higher grades. The report explicitly concludes that “a one-size-fits-all approach will not work” for CS education​
URBAN.ORG
. In other words, simply mandating coding in the curriculum doesn’t guarantee effective or equal outcomes. Schools and students have different needs, and a blanket requirement can lead to superficial compliance rather than meaningful learning. This evidence supports the idea that forcing everyone down the same coding path is ineffective, and that education should be adaptable rather than uniform.

  Highlights flaws in CS-for-all programs like CS4All in NYC, where implementation has been deeply uneven.</p>

  <h2>3. Better Alternatives for Many Learners</h2>
  <div class="comment">Coding isn’t the only way to teach logic, creativity, or digital skills.

Opinion: “Mandatory Coding Classes May Not Be Necessary” – Patrick Gray (2016). Gray suggests that while coding builds certain 21st-century skills, it’s not the only way to learn them. He lists other hands-on courses and hobbies that also teach problem-solving, project design, and troubleshooting – “wood shop, cooking and baking, advanced mathematics, or designing a house” can all develop the same analytical and technical competencies as coding​
EDUCATIONWORLD.COM
. For many students who have no interest in programming, these alternative avenues may be more engaging and relevant. The point is that a student can become a creative, critical thinker via routes better suited to their interests (e.g. engineering through robotics, logical thinking through chess or debate, creativity through art) instead of writing code. Gray’s argument is that educators should guide each learner to the medium that best cultivates their skills – and for some, that medium will not be computer code.
“Why children should NOT be taught to code” – David Buckingham (July 13, 2015). Buckingham, an education professor, questions the assumption that coding has unique benefits. He notes there is “no convincing evidence that learning computer programming enables children to develop more general problem-solving skills, let alone ‘teach you how to think’”​
DAVIDBUCKINGHAM.NET
. Other activities – from music to math puzzles – claim similar cognitive benefits, and we don’t presume those should be mandatory for all. Buckingham argues that if the goal is improving thinking skills or job skills, many learners might be better served by improving digital literacy or other fundamentals rather than coding syntax. He also warns that overemphasizing coding could divert resources from other subjects that a student might find more rewarding. This perspective supports the idea that for many learners, there are better or more suitable learning priorities than coding, and that we shouldn’t elevate coding above other valuable skills or assume it’s a cure-all in education.</div>

  Argues that the cognitive benefits of coding are overstated; many other activities teach similar skills.</p>

  <h2>4. Technological Abstraction Reduces Need</h2>
  <div class="comment">With AI and no-code tools, people can build tech without traditional programming.

“Jensen Huang says kids shouldn’t learn to code — they should leave it up to AI” – Mark Tyson, Tom’s Hardware (Feb 25, 2024). The CEO of Nvidia, a leading tech company, made waves by suggesting that with the rise of artificial intelligence, coding will become less important for the average person. At the 2024 World Government Summit, Huang argued that “programming is no longer a vital skill” for most people because AI can generate code from human instructions​
TOMSHARDWARE.COM
. Thanks to modern AI tools, individuals can create software or automate tasks by using plain language prompts instead of writing code line-by-line. Huang’s point is that future workers might be better off focusing on domain expertise (in fields like biology, manufacturing, farming, etc.) while leveraging AI-driven tools to handle the programming. In his words, “with coding taken care of by AI, humans can instead focus on more valuable expertise”​
TOMSHARDWARE.COM
. This viewpoint suggests that not everyone needs to learn coding themselves; as technology evolves, high-level tools and AI will abstract away programming complexity for end users. Essentially, coding is becoming like an engine under the hood – one needs to know how to drive the car, but not necessarily how to build the engine.
“Nvidia CEO predicts the death of coding — AI will do the work” – Benedict Collins, TechRadar (Feb 26, 2024). (Supporting the above) This article reports Huang’s statements in context, noting that he “breaks with tradition” from tech leaders who for years urged everyone to code. It underscores his claim that natural language AI tools can make programming languages obsolete for most users​
TOMSHARDWARE.COM
​
TOMSHARDWARE.COM
. While experts debate the timeline of this shift, the trend is clear: technologies such as no-code platforms, AI code generators (like GitHub’s Copilot), and increasingly powerful software tools mean that people can implement ideas without traditional coding knowledge. For example, a small business owner can build a website using a no-code editor, or a scientist can use AI to analyze data without writing a program. These sources reinforce the argument that requiring everyone to learn coding might soon be outdated – technological advancements are lowering the need for individual coding skills in many scenarios.</div>

  <h2>5. Equity and Resource Issues</h2>
  <div class="comment">Not all schools have the tools or teachers needed to offer quality CS education to every student.

“Equity-Focused Challenges in CS” – Leah L. Aiwohi, Computer Science Teachers Association (June 14, 2024). This article by CSTA equity fellows highlights that making coding education available to all is easier said than done. One primary challenge is unequal access to resources and infrastructure​
CSTEACHERS.ORG
. Schools in affluent areas tend to have computer labs, broadband, and trained CS teachers, whereas students in underserved communities often “lack access to up-to-date hardware, software, and reliable internet,” and their schools “struggle to recruit and retain qualified CS teachers.”​
CSTEACHERS.ORG
​
CSTEACHERS.ORG
 These disparities mean that a universal coding mandate could widen achievement gaps: wealthier schools can implement robust coding programs, while high-poverty schools might only offer minimal or subpar instruction. The source argues that without significant investment in teacher training and infrastructure, pushing CS for all will benefit those with resources and leave behind those without, exacerbating equity issues.
“Moving the Needle on Equity in Computer Science Education” – Urban Institute (2023). Data from New York City’s rollout of “CS4All” reveals persistent gaps in who actually gets computer science education. By 2021–22, Black and Latinx students were far less likely to have taken a coding course than their White and Asian peers (only 17% of Black and ~20% of Latinx students had taken CS by graduation, versus 28% of Asian students)​
URBAN.ORG
. Girls were also slightly less likely than boys to take CS classes​
URBAN.ORG
. These participation gaps reflect systemic issues – from bias and stereotypes to the lack of role models and support – that can’t be fixed just by declaring “everyone must code.” Additionally, the Urban Institute notes that nearly half of schools in NYC weren’t reaching even 10% of their students with CS instruction​
URBAN.ORG
. In short, implementing coding for all has proven difficult, and those left out tend to be students already disadvantaged. This supports the argument that making coding a universal requirement without addressing underlying inequities (like funding and bias) could reinforce educational inequalities. It might divert resources from basic needs in some schools and place additional burdens on under-resourced districts. In summary, critics say that “everyone should learn coding” could unintentionally deepen divides unless equity issues are resolved first.</div>

  <h2>6. Cultural and Educational Overreach</h2>
  <div class="comment">Coding is sometimes pushed too hard — to the point of ignoring culture, context, or creative fields.

“Why children should NOT be taught to code” – David Buckingham (Prof. of Education), Personal blog (July 13, 2015). Buckingham provides a skeptical analysis of the coding craze, calling it a “tsunami of hype” propelled by tech companies and government initiatives​
DAVIDBUCKINGHAM.NET
. He notes that similar pushes for school programming happened in the 1980s and were later abandoned. One concern is that the current fervor for coding in every classroom may be more about ideology and industry agendas than students’ true needs. For example, a 2011 UK report by video game industry executives led to coding’s inclusion in the curriculum – Buckingham points out those authors were “creative entrepreneurs…rather than computer scientists,” implying they had economic motives​
DAVIDBUCKINGHAM.NET
. He warns that we should be wary of educational overreach, where we expect coding to magically improve general intellect or fix the economy. His commentary suggests that forcing all kids to code could crowd out other cultural and educational priorities such as the arts, critical thinking in humanities, or civic education. “If we want to revive our games industry,” Buckingham writes, “we need imaginative scenarios and compelling characters, not just lines of code.” Tech industries actually need creative talent, not an army of “programming drones.”​
DAVIDBUCKINGHAM.NET
 This striking phrase underscores the risk of overreach: by obsessively promoting coding, we might produce graduates proficient in Java or Python but who lack creativity, social skills, or other competencies that a well-rounded education provides.
“Colleges Shouldn’t Overfocus on Technical Skills” – Ben Kennedy, Inside Higher Ed (Sept 1, 2020). Although about higher education, this opinion echoes the cultural concern that an extreme emphasis on coding/technical training can undermine broader learning. Kennedy argues that if institutions cater too much to immediate tech skills, society could end up with a two-tier system: a small elite gets rich, liberal education (learning to think, lead, create) while everyone else is trained narrowly for coding jobs and easily automated tasks. This overreach in tech-focused education could “reinforce equity gaps with a vengeance,” creating what he calls a dystopia of “technical workers” versus “creative thinkers”​
INSIDEHIGHERED.COM
​
INSIDEHIGHERED.COM
. The implication is that insisting everyone learn coding might inadvertently devalue other fields and forms of knowledge that are crucial for innovation and democracy. In a healthy education system, technical and liberal arts skills complement each other. Critics say we should avoid swinging the pendulum so far that coding is seen as a cure-all. Not every student will be a programmer, and that’s okay – we also need writers, artists, nurses, entrepreneurs, and others with diverse talents. The “everyone must code” movement, these sources suggest, sometimes veers into overreach by elevating one skill above all others, which could narrow the educational experience and ignore cultural context. A more balanced approach would recognize coding as just one of many valuable skills, rather than a universal requirement.
